# Krugs - Simple daemon manager <img src="http://i.imgur.com/IJ6EHnq.png"/> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/59R7gD9.png"/>

Krugs is a simple manager for daemon processes. It is easier to use and
to deploy than using/creating init scripts for the Unix `service` command.
Also, every user can use Krugs, not just root.
